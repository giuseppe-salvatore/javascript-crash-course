There are 8 data types in Moder Javascript, 7 are primitive data types (not combined)

- boolean
- number
- bigint
- string
- null (although typeof null will give you object, this is a bug javascript.info/types)
- undefined
- symbol
- function??? that doesn't exist as a type although if you ask typeof fucntion foo() {} this will return function (still early days of js javascript.info/types)

and 1 non-primitive

- object
